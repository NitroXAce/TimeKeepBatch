# TimeKeepBatch
Making a time keep batch file to keep track of times on task, how long on each task, and the details after time calculations. 

## It starts with a begin!
When the client begins the timecheck, it should store the time, this variable also will be overwritten later once the command ends.

## Clocking out already?
When the client enters this stage, the time pasted will be shown, and stored.  This is where the calculations happen, and will be added to the "total time spent" category.  Making math more intuitive!

## Theres got to be a reason for this?
At the end of "clocking out," we want to describe our tasks once time has already been figured, while understandably people people don't want to pay for the explination, it can be nice, no?

## Finally
At the end of the day, its just a time keeping tracker filled with reasons for tasks, a nice edition to help with company payrolls, or other monetary timekeeping!
